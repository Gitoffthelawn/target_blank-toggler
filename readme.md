# `target="_blank"`-toggler

This extension was developped along with this [blog post](https://augustin-riedinger.fr/en/resources/thoughts-on-target-blank/).

You can download it in official registries:

- **[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/targetblank-toggler/emjjmkkcdllendgbldliiphlbpnomnjk)**
- **[Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/target-_blank-toggler/)**

## Usage

It does basically two things:

1. Changes the cursor to this one ![External link cursor](/images/cursor-ext.png) when hovering a `target="_blank"` link
2. Toggles the `target="_blank"` attributes on links while pressing `x`

## TODO

Contributions welcome! Here's what would be nice:

- being able to customize the key (simple)
- being able to customize the cursors (harder)
